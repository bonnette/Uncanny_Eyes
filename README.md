<br/>
This is a modification of the Adafruit Uncanny Eyes sketch Written by Phil Burgess <br/>
https://github.com/adafruit/Uncanny_Eyes <br/>
My modification allows you to use the Adafruit 0.96 inch mini color OLED (using the Adafruit_SSD1331 driver)<br/>
This repository contains a defaultEyes1.h file that modifies the graphics table so the eye<br/>
fits into the smaller (96X64) display.<br/>
The old version (lower case ssd in the name) does not work with the Trinket M0 and only works with one eye<br/>
I left the old version intact for reference purposes only.<br/>
The newer version (uppercase SSD in the name) works with the Trinket M0 and has a config.h file like<br/>
the original one from Adafruit. It works with two eyes and doesn't step on code from the original author <br/>
I want to thank Adafruit for providing the code and drivers for this modification and would encourage everyone to show your support for their efforts by making purchases of the hardware necessary to complete this project from Adafruit.
