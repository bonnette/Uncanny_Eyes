<br/>
This is a modification of the Adafruit Uncanny Eyes sketch Written by Phil Burgess <br/>
https://github.com/adafruit/Uncanny_Eyes <br/>
My modification allows you to use the Adafruit 0.96 inch mini color OLED (using the Adafruit_SSD1331 driver)<br/>
This modification removes the need for a config.h file. It also contains a defaultEyes1.h file that is used to modify<br/>
the graphics table so the eye fits into the smaller (96X64) display.<br/>
The newer version I added (uppercase SSD in the name) works with the Trinket M0 and has a config.h file like<br/>
the origional one from Adafruit. It works with two eyes and doesn't step on code from the origional author <br/>
I want to thank Adafruit for providing the code and drivers for this modification and would encourage everyone to show your support  for their effort by making purchases of the hardware necessary to complete this project from Adafruit.
